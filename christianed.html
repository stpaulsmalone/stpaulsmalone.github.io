	                    <p>St. Paul's offers Sunday School on second and fourth Sundays of each month. On first and third Sundays, children learn the good news by attending and participating in worship. We also hold "Messy Church" on fifth Sundays (a hands-on learning experience in worship) and "Mossy Church" in the summer (learning about God's creation outdoors). We are committed to forming kids with strong minds, strong hearts, and strong faith. Questions are encouraged.</p>
