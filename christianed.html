  <p>Owls and whales and curious minds, oh my!</p>
	<p>St. Paul's offers Sunday School on second and fourth Sundays of each month. On first and third Sundays, children learn the good news by attending and participating in worship. We also hold "Messy Church" on fifth Sundays (a hands-on learning experience in worship) and "Mossy Church" in the summer (learning about God's creation outdoors). We are committed to forming kids with strong minds, strong hearts, and strong faith. Questions are encouraged.</p>
  <p>As an extension of our Christian Education program, we support the outdoor ministry program of the Wisconsin Conference at <a href="https://ucci.org">Pilgrim Center and Moon Beach</a> camps. We encourage children to participate in camp opportunities, and provide scholarships toward camp fees.</p>
