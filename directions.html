<h2>How To Find Us</h2>
<div class="content no-columns find">
<p>In the old days, it was easy to tell people where to find St. Paul's: we were "the church by the marsh." That's still true, but you might need some updated landmarks.</p>

<p>We're located on St. Paul Road near the village of Pipe (not Malone proper). From 151, either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Turn east on County Road W by Capone's or The Beer Run<a title="This is Wisconsin, after all.">*</a>. Follow W to Kiel Rd. Turn north onto Kiel Rd. just after Lake Breeze Dairy, then west onto St. Paul Rd. Go past the cemetery. The church will be on your right.</li>
    <li>Turn east on County Road HH by LaClare Farms. Follow HH to St. Paul Rd. Turn south. The church will be on your left.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the east, follow HH or Kiel Rd to St. Paul Rd. Easy!</p>
