<h2>A Loving and Supportive Community</h2>
{% include custom-photo.html %}

<div class="content no-columns loving">
	
	<p>The people of St. Paul's are very clear on what they value about their church: the close, rich relationships and building-up that happens naturally in a small community. We like to talk about being accepted for who we are and being cared for in times of need.</p>
	<p>Hear for yourself! We asked members about a time they felt loved in the church. Here's a small sample of what they said:</p>
	<ul class="no-bullets italic">
		<li>"We embrace each other as a family&mdash;when one’s family is not near (with dinner or a personal touch)"</li>
		<li>"Acts of service for friends and neighbors&mdash;sharing of talents"</li>
		<li>"My opinions were valued by pastor and others"</li>
		<li>"There's a shoulder to cry on always"</li>
		<li>"We have an open, welcoming feeling&mdash;about church, communion, conversations, nonjudgmental, tolerant"</li>
		<li>"With the encouragement of church family"</li>
		<li>"A sense of welcome from multiple church members upon entering"</li>
		<li>"Being recognized and acknowledged"</li>
		<li>"The feeling of not being judged"</li>
		<li>"Respect, love, genuine care (such as with the Women’s Fellowship)"</li>
		<li>"Compassion for each other&mdash;death in family or friend"</li>
	</ul>
