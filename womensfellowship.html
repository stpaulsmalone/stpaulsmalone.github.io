  <p>Since <a href="../history/index.html#womenshistory">at least 1918</a>, St. Paul's has had a secret superpower: the Women's Fellowship. The longest-running social group in the congregation, Women's Fellowship is the backbone for much of what happens around the church. They sing and play handbells at local nursing homes, provide catering for funeral lunches, organize bake sales and parents' nights out, pay for janitorial services, and conduct charity drives for the Holyland Food Pantry, among many other organizations.</p>
  <p>They also provide fellowship, of course, with educational programs, field trips, lunches, dinners, and Tuesdays Together in the summer.</p>
