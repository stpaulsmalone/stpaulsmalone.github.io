Anyone who's had children knows that it's exciting when they come, and even more exciting when they go&mdash;that is, when they become independent and strike out on their own as adults.

So it is that I report that this coming Sunday will be Kailee Simon's last with us. Sunday the 13th was Kaylee Warner's last time; she and Morgan Groeschl will soon be rooming together at college. Kaylee left a very gracious note with me:

<blockquote>Dear St. Paul's UCC,

Thank you for awarding me with your wonderful scholarship. I am excited for my future at UW River Falls, and truly appreciate your support. Thank you for teaching me the way of God throughout my childhood. I hope to carry your message of faith and spread hope everywhere.

Thank you again,

Kaylee Warner</blockquote>

Thank *you*, Kaylee. We appreciate everything you've done, and hope you won't be a stranger.

The final Tuesday Together of 2017 will conclude…with a Wednesday Together!

<blockquote>Wednesday, September 6th - 6:30 p.m.<br /><br />
Hostess:  Beth Miller<br /><br />
N10744 <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=N10744+Artesia+Beach+Road+%0D+Malone,+WI&entry=gmail&source=g">Artesia Beach Road</a> Malone, WI<br /><br />
Come for an evening of socializing and watching the sunset over gorgeous Lake Winnebago!</blockquote>

Tuesdays Together will start up again in June 2018. Don't worry, in the meantime, we'll find plenty of ways to socialize together.

## 2. 

Another thank you, this time from the Mission Committee:

>Thank you to everyone who filled pack backs. Parent and kids were very excited and thankful to receive them.  Mission Committee’s next project will be a trip to Ronald McDonald House in Madison on Saturday, Oct 14 to prepare an evening meal for their guests. More details after our next meeting on August 28. It’s a mission project that children can come on.

## 3.

Don't forget to RSVP for the September 10th congregational meeting! We don't want you to miss out on sub sandwiches, now do we? You can call the church office (920-795-4505), or sign the sheet when it comes around in worship.


## 4.

So I don't repeat the mistake I made last time: We will formally take in new members in worship on **Sunday, September 17th**. Be there or…not, I guess.


## 5.

If you weren't around for the final Mossy Church last week, we had 13 people show up for the program, including 3 visitors from outside the congregation. I don't know what Stephanie's got planned, but I'm hoping we can do it again next summer.


## 6.

So this happened today:

The concrete was donated by the Holyland Food Pantry to make it easier to get donations and people in and out of the parsonage. I know I'll appreciate the sidewalk, at the very least!


## 7.

Scriptures for this week:

 	</li>
 </ul>

That psalm is really something.

## 8.

One more thing: if, like me, you're a great fan of European churches, you might want to check out the [Sacred Wales](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=a089fca73b&e=b4a5fc0bb8) site. They're having a contest to choose Wales' favorite churches, some of which date back the 11th century or earlier. [This one's](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=f6198843c3&e=b4a5fc0bb8) probably my favorite. Unless it's [this one](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=5e236719f1&e=b4a5fc0bb8) (you should see [the interior](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=9e80654cfa&e=b4a5fc0bb8)). Or maybe [this one](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=f22c1e10e2&e=b4a5fc0bb8) on an island? Oh, and how did I miss [this one](http://facebook.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=cce5979cb8d714dfb55755a36&id=20385ca3e7&e=b4a5fc0bb8)?!

Oh, dear. I could be here all day.
