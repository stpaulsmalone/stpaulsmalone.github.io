## 1.

As announced in last's week <em>Apostle</em>, we will be taking up a special collection this Sunday <em>both</em> for One Great Hour of Sharing (the UCC's annual mission and disaster relief offering) <em>and</em> for the Wisconsin Council of Churches, whose Executive Director Rev. Kerri Parker will be joining us in worship.

More properly, we're taking up <strong>one</strong> collection, which we're then splitting between the two groups. This makes it easy for you: simply take your donation and place it in the envelope you will find in your bulletin. We'll take it from there!

## 2.

Also on Sunday: I will bring a couple of sign-up sheets for people interested in helping Tom Tomter get around, or in making dinner for him. Please sign up! Between now and then, can I have at least one volunteer to bring Tom to church?

As always, <a href="http://www.stpaulsmalone.org/prayer/#add-prayers">keep praying</a> for Tom, and for all in need.

## 3.

I've added our Holy Week schedule to the calendar. As in the past couple of years, we will <em>not</em> have a Wednesday night gathering during Holy Week. This year, rather than observe an Upper Room service, we will hold a Tenebrae service with scripture readings and the gradual extinguishing of lights. On Good Friday, the church will be open for quiet prayer and meditation. We won't have a slideshow Stations of the Cross, but the booklet will be available.

## 4. 

On Easter Saturday (April 7), Mark Schubert's recorder group will be playing a brief concert at the Chilton Public Library. Mark didn't have exact information yet, but it should be right around closing time (1:00) or shortly before. I'll pass on the details as I get them.

## 5.

There will be a Holyland Blood Drive on March 20!
 
March is Red Cross Month and area residents will have the opportunity to help in its lifesaving mission by giving blood on Tuesday, March 20. All blood types are needed and donations will be accepted at Maximillians in Mt. Calvary from 11:45 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 
Donating blood makes a big difference in the lives of others and one donation can help save up to three people. Persons who are healthy, weigh 110 pounds or more, and are at least 17 years old (age 16 with parental consent) can give blood.
 
Walk-ins are welcome. As is tradition, donors will be treated to a light lunch compliments of local area contributors, businesses, and volunteers

This is one of the weirder sets of readings you will encounter in the Lectionary, to be honest.
