As I said on Sunday morning, not a lot goes on the week between Christmas and New Year's, so there aren't very many announcements on which to keep you posted this week. To make up for it, I've included a few of the photos from December that I've neglected to put on the church Facebook page.

If you weren't here for the Christmas Eve service, you missed a treat! The kids did a great job singing, reading, and leading the worship service. Many thanks to all who participated and worked so hard to pull it off.

This coming Sunday! I am threatening to bring some &aelig;bleskiver for fellowship time. Jen probably thinks I'm nuts for wanting to make them <em>again</em>, but some of you have expressed curiosity about how they're made, and what they wind up tasting like. Also, I kind of enjoy playing Johnny &AElig;bleskiverseed, so why not?

## 2.

As part of our drive to live up to our core value of hospitality, at least <strike>one</strike> two large-print bulletins will be available at each worship service. If you or someone you love would benefit from a large-print edition, please let Pastor Dan know so we can make enough copies available. 

Along the same lines, we have been working on the church microphones, and we do have a hearing loop installed. But if you're still finding it difficult to hear what's going on, please let Pastor or Dwight know so we can work on trying to find a solution that works for you. The same goes for any barrier to participation: let us know, and we'll tear it down. We probably can't make the church perfectly accessible, but that doesn't mean we can't die trying.

## 3.

In the liturgical season of Christmas (between Christmas Day and Epiphany), there are no fasts in the Eastern Orthodox churches. They know when they're fighting a losing battle.

Some quick announcements:

<ul>

  <li>We're taking the Christmas decorations down after church on January 15th. Come help. It doesn't take long, and it's appreciated.</li>
  <li>Book Club will meet at 6:30 on Thursday, January 4 at the parsonage. The book of the month is <em>Wonder</em> by R.J. Palacio. Everyone is welcome.</li>
</ul>

## 5.

I'll talk more about this next week, but at our annual congregational meeting on January 28th, I'd like us to formally adopt the core values that came out of the Cottage Meetings this summer. Just to refresh your memory, those were:
- <em>Community</em> as the body of Christ
- <em>Hospitality</em> for one another and the community
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
- <em>Rootedness</em> in history
- <em>Ministry</em> to one another and to the community

Please, feel free to share any thoughts you might have on these values.
