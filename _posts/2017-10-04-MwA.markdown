A very brief update today, as I got a bit sidetracked talking to people, which is…sort of my job, so I was glad to do it!

Anyway:

## 1.

We need someone to host Fellowship Time after worship this coming Sunday! Please talk to Nancy Beckman if you're able to do so. She has generously offered to split the work if need be.



## 2.

Today would have been Gloria Sattler's 95th(?) birthday. Think of her and her family when you say your prayers tonight.


## 3.

We've had a bit of transition on the Building Committee. Tom and Lori Schmitz have decided to step down, and thank you for your service. Meanwhile, Margaret Nikkah and Blair Mills have volunteered to join the team. Thank you to current members and new, and as always, we'll keep you posted.

## 4.

We are still looking for volunteers—adults and children—to help with serving and preparing dinner at the Ronald McDonald House in Madison on October 14th. We will be making a taco and loaded potato bar so the preparations will be pretty easy. Please, if you are interested in going on this mini-mission trip, let Nancy Beckman (920-418-4484, nancy@curdknives.com) or Joanne Burris (920-894-7552) know.


## 5.

Apparently I messed up and sent out a link to an earlier draft of the slide deck for our September 10th Future Building meeting. Here (I hope) is [the correct document](../documents/9-10-17BuildingMeeting.ppt).

Also! [Council minutes from August](8-16-17.docx). As always, paper copies are available, and ask Ann Martin if you'd like a copy of the Treasurer's report.


## 6.

Scriptures for Sunday:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=372937787">Jonah 3:10-4:11</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=372937787">Psalm 145:1-8</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=372937787">Philippians 1:21-30</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=372937787">Matthew 20:1-16</a></li>
</ul>

Did you know Jonah got along in the belly of the whale? I learned that from Hank Williams.
