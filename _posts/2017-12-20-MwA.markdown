Last week I told you about getting involved in a new ministry with the Fond du Lac Suicide Prevention Task Force. Today, I'd like to talk about another ministry I've recently taken on, one that might feel a little more familiar.

I went to visit Myra Maurer at Willowdale not too long ago, and asked if they ever had worship services there. It turns out there's a regular Catholic service, but only one Protestant service a month at most. The activities director overheard the conversation and so here we are: starting at <strong>10:00 on Friday, January 26th</strong>, I will be offering a monthly worship service at Willowdale. We'll sing a few songs, say some prayers, have a brief reflection. It'll be nice.

In the past, some of you have enjoyed going to Willowdale to sing and spend time with the residents. If you haven't come along for the Women's Fellowship outings, they are richly rewarding. And, frankly, I could use some help with the services. (In particular, you don't want to rely on me to lead the singing.) I'd like to invite anyone who's interested in coming along, if you have some free time on a Friday morning. Ministry doesn't have to be grand, nor take a lot of time or money. Sometimes, it's just showing up and keeping someone company for an hour.

As we come down the homestretch of Advent into Christmas, let us consider how God became present to us in Jesus, and how we might make him present to others in our lives and work. Consider signing up to go to Willowdale and let me know. (I'll repeat this message in worship so everybody gets the chance to hear it.)

As part of our drive to live up to our core value of hospitality, at least one large-print bulletin will be available at each worship service. If you or someone you love would benefit from a large-print edition, please let Pastor Dan know so we can make enough copies available. 

Along the same lines, we have been working on the church microphones, and we do have a hearing loop installed. But if you're still finding it difficult to hear what's going on, please let Pastor or Dwight know so we can work on trying to find a solution that works for you. The same goes for any barrier to participation: let us know, and we'll tear it down. We probably can't make the church perfectly accessible, but that doesn't mean we can't die trying.

## 2.

I mentioned last week that there will be a signficant gap between church income and expenses in 2018. The Council and I are fairly confident that we'll make ends meet through a combination of giving and fundraising. We trust that God will provide. At the same time, we'd like to verify!

As I said in a sermon a couple of weeks back, <em>now</em> is the time to do the right thing. Don't greet Jesus come back to earth with a handful of IOU's to the place where you find support, solace, and spirituality. Please, if it's within your power, make a plan to give <u>regularly</u> throughout 2018. And remember, monthly financial reports are always available. We want you to know what's going on.

Some quick announcements:

<ul>
  <li>Reports for the Annual meeting are due to Marilynn no later than Sunday, Jan 7. You can email them to her at: <a href="mailto:groneng@me.com">groneng@me.com</a></li>
  <li>We're taking the Christmas decorations down after church on January 15th. Come help. It doesn't take long, and it's appreciated.</li>
  <li>Book Club will meet at 6:30 on Thursday, January 4 at the parsonage. The book of the month is <em>Wonder</em> by R.J. Palacio. Everyone is welcome.</li>
</ul>

Rats! Well, mice, anyway. We've been having some four-legged, long-tailed visitors to the church recently. As committed to hospitality as we are, mice and other rodents are guests we just can't accommodate. Please be aware that we've set out a few traps around the church. You can help the situation by making sure that food isn't left out, but makes it to a trash can instead.

Oh, and one last thing? In case you're ever tempted to worry about how bad things get at St. Paul's, just read this story about <a href="http://time.com/5067713/cow-philadelphia-nativity-scene/">a cow who escaped a live nativity</a> scene to wander the streets of Philadelphia. Twice. The second time they found her on the fourth floor of a parking ramp.

On the other hand, maybe some excitement would help with the budget?
