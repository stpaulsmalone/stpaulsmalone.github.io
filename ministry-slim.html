  <p>Ministry is important to us at St. Paul's. Our largest mission is participation in the <a href="../hfp/">Holyland Food Pantry</a>, but we do continue to support others as well. We've held several collections for children:</p> 
    <ul>
       <li>Laptops for students in Namibia</li>
       <li>Shoes for Belize</li>
       <li>Backpacks and books for the Holyland Food Pantry the past two summers</li>
       <li>Clothes and gifts for local children every Christmas</li>
    </ul>
  <p>We also support a rotating fund of KIVA loans, more than 700 loans totaling $17,500. Our <a href="https://www.kiva.org/">KIVA fund</a> has served inviduals in 73 different nations. 80% of loan recipients are women.</p>
  <p>In recent years, we've taken ministry trips as close as the Ronald McDonald House in Madison and as far away as the Black Hills of South Dakota or the Henderson Settlement in Frakes, KY. We are organizing a new round of trips in 2018 and 2019.</p>
