      <p>At St. Paul's, we know that we are recipients of God's amazing generosity. God has fed us in so many ways. That's why, since 2015, the Holyland Food Pantry&mdash;a cooperative ministry of St. Paul's and several partners&mdash;has shared space with our offices in the St. Paul's parsonage.</p>
      <p>HFP distributes on the third Friday of each month, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. They support several dozen families in the Holyland.</p>
      <p>Non-perishable donations can be dropped off in the large box on the parsonage porch.</p>
      <p><strong>If you or someone you know is in need of food assistance, please call 920-418-1580. All calls and information will remain confidential.</strong></p>
