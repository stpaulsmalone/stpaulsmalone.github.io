He was ordained in 1999.</p>
	
	<p>Dan has served mostly small, mostly rural congregations in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. An accomplished blogger and writer, he has been published in <em>The Christian Century</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, and <em>Religion Dispatches</em>, among other outlets. He is the author of one book. Dan has occasionally taught as an adjunct instructor at Marian University and Lakeland University in theology and first-year studies. He currently serves as the editor of the Northeast Association newsletter.</p>
