<div class="textwrap-right">
  <p>We are an intentionally welcoming, accepting and affirming congregation, including across generational lines.</p>
  <p>We prize our openness and want to extend our table. That starts with the Lord's Supper, where there are no barriers, no tests to pass before you can receive. It continues with fellowship: after church, in the book club, visiting an old friend at the nursing home, talking away a summer evening on the shore of Lake Winnebago, or in our many social gatherings. No matter who you are, pull up a chair. You're always welcome here.</p>
